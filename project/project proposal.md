### Topic Proposed
#### Description
What are you planning to do?

We are going to use [This Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emirhanai/social-media-usage-and-emotional-well-being) to identify key contributors to mental health issues through the usage of social media.

What are the features you plan to use, and what are the values to be predicted?

Age, Sex, and Platform will be great contributors to classification. Along with their daily usage(hours), daily likes, daily comments, and daily messages.

we will use these characteristics to predict a dominant emotion (Happiness, Sadness, Anger, Anxiety, Boredom, Neutral)
#### Motivation
Why do you believe this topic is worth trying? Is it an interesting topic to you? Or is it meaningful to society?
#### Feasibility
Any related data set you found online? What are the properties of the data sets? What are the available attributes/features, what percentage of the entries are missing? Etc.
What other tools do you plan to use? (e.g. ChatGPT, GPT4) Why do you need them? How are those tools / libraries relevant to your project?
What is the estimated amount of work you have in mind? (e.g. how to split work, and why you believe you and your teammates can handle the workload)
